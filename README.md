# Get Spotify
## A Set of R Functions For Extracting Data Through Spotify's API

### Dominic Dayta

Required packages: `httr`. Note that a lot of the procedures used in these codes were written to introduce as little foreign dependencies as possible, and as such depends heavily on base R syntax and native objects such as stings and dataframes. The code would arguably be faster with the introduction of tidy procedures, say with `data.table` and `dplyr`, but that, I felt, was beside the point.

Interested users can adapt these codes and are welcome to introduce improvements on both speed and flexibility.

The accompanying Medium post can be read [here](https://medium.com/@stochasticism/accessing-spotifys-api-using-r-1a8eef0507c). If these codes helped you with a project or two, I'd greatly appreciate a shoutout. Forks and pull requests are more than welcome.
